# Angular Opener | OPEN SESAME!

Angular Opener is a tiny little itty-bitty extension for Code that makes it convenient to open all of the files (html, ts, css, and so on) that are part of an Angular component. It's admittedly a pretty narrow use-case, but I wanted it, and once I'd written it, it seemed silly not to publish it. I welcome your thoughts on this strange dichotomy which plagues open-source engineers everywhere.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements
The only thing Angular Opener requires to work is that you have one or more Angular CLI projects (with a corresponding `angular.json` file) in your workspace. It asks little and gives... well, little. What? They can't all be winners.

## Extension Settings

Angular Opener contributes the following settings:

* `angular-opener.enable`: enable/disable this extension

## Known Issues
I have no idea how people write Angular apps in JS (i.e., without Typescript), but I think they can, and if they do, this extension currently doesn't open those files. 

## Release Notes
### 1.0.0
Initial release of Angular Opener. The way is open!
